## Libraries used
ReactJS - 18.2.0\
npm - 10.5.1\
Tailwind CSS - 3.4.3\
Vite - 5.2.0\
daisyUI - 4.10.1


## How to configure
Clone the repository and install the dependencies (`npm` and the like). Run ``` npm insall ``` to install any additional dependancies.

## How to Run
In the directory to which the repository was cloned, run the ``` npm run dev ``` command. When Vite runs, click the link to the local server to view the app. 

## How to contribute ? 
The application is incomplete and it needs most importantly a mechanism to save the events and render the saved events onto the calendar GUI. 
A database to store the events and event details and an API to fetch this data to the front-end is also necessary.
